# Machine engine

Machine Engine is a pet project game engine developed in my spare time.

# Basic purpose

  - Develop skills in architecture, compilers, networking, physics, version control, mobile platforms and overall game engine development
  - Obtain knowledge about various components of game engines, their purpose and how they work
  - Research available open sourced solutions and learn their pros and cons
  - Document the learning process to see what were the intentions behind the decisions made
  - Create some game prototypes with the engine
  - Use this repository as a showcase of skills and abilities
  - Last but not least, have some fun creating my own game engine
